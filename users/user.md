# INTRODUCTION

* HRHIS General Introduction                                                    
HRHIS is an open-source software for HRH information management developed by the Department of
Computer Science, University of Dar es Salaam for the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare
(Tanzania) to support the capture of data linked to any level in the organizational hierarchy
and is customizable at both the input and output sides.
The HRHIS was implemented as an effort to improve human resources for health (HRH) management.
A situation analysis indicated the existence of several databases within and outside the
ministry dealing with HRH, often with similar information fields. It was agreed these sources
should be harmonized, and housed under Health Management Information System (HMIS) for
consistency. The HRHIS software thus became part of the HMIS and was fully developed using the
District Health Information System (DHIS) software.

The HRHIS provides input/output mechanisms for data at different levels, such as national,
regional, district or facility level. It is designed to provide flexibility to:

* Capture and store health personnel's data and history by organizational unit, cadre, and other
criteria;

* Add any number of datasets or elements required by any sector (such as the central health
  ministry, local governments, civil services or private providers);

* Update organizational unit details according to users' requirements (e.g. allowing additional
  regions, districts and health facilities to be added dynamically without entering into system
  codes);

* Generate web-enabled reports in different formats (general and aggregated), including
graphical reporting.

## Objective
